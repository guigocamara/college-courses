this time we are going to test how good you )@(!)@*0420930294 2q **clean up #*!(@*(938293))is. this file is going to h889391829182ave a ton of !(@*(! ))<:}{}" random characters and 29389123 symbols in it. The goal is for this to be a cohesive string of (@)!@()!#310390 lowercase letters. This is also going to test how you can handle an extremely short key with a very long plain text file. You should be just fine, and if this does not work then ()@*!()@*)!(@!(_)@(!@:{@L:!@})) you should check out the method in which you clean up these strings for encryption. Remember that all characters aside from lowercase a-z should be either eliminated or converted (if its A-Z). (@*!()@*!:"":)well anyway i hope you enjoyed my ted talk have a good @*(!@*)!(@!)(@*!(
