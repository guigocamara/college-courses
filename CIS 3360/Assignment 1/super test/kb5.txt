i am just a lonely little text file, watch me sing my a b cs 
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y and Z
yayyyy i did such a good job. now watch me sing my a b cs but backwards
z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g  f c d c b a
i bet you read that so quickly that you didn't realize i repeated a few letters, oh, you checked and didn't find a repeat? gotcha!
just kidding, i actually did repeat a c, i guess im not as good at my abcs as i thought i was. oh well, i guess i can try to sing my qwerty alphabet
`~ 1! 2@ 3# 4$ 5% 6^ 7& 8* 9( 0) -_ =+ q w e r t y u i o p [{ ]} \| a s d f g h j k l ;: '" z x c v b n m ,< .> /?
